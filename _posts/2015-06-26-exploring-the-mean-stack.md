One of the things that I love about [Turing](http://www.turing.io/) is the fact that the program and its instructors try to turn us into extremely diverse developers. One way they do that is by requiring us to do a Lightning Talk once a module after you complete Module 1. While your first talk in Module 2 doesn't have to be technical and can be about any topic you like, such as your career before software development, the others that follow should be something coding or technology related.

Since we're always so busy with classwork and don't usually have time for much else, I've been using my Lightning Talks as an opportunity to explore topics that I find interesting, but usually don't have the time to.

My talk was originally shared over at the Turing's blog. Here's my description from the school's blog:  

<blockquote> At Turing, students are taught to become diverse developers who are able to think logically and can use any programming language as a tool to solve a problem. In my Module 3 Lightning Talk, I chose to explore the MEAN Stack. The MEAN Stack is made up of four frameworks: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js. It uses a single language across the entire stack and has been said to increase productivity. I realize that I may not be programming in Ruby and Rails after Turing, so I wanted to explore other frameworks and drive deeper into JavaScript.

My screencast/presentation is also over on Turing's Vimeo channel, but to make it easier, here it is:
